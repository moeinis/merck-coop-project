# Bot Detection for Email Engagement  
**Merck & Co. | Data Science Co-op Project | Moein Izadi**

This project focuses on detecting inorganic email engagement behavior—such as bot-generated opens and clicks—in digital marketing campaigns targeting healthcare professionals (HCPs). Building on prior work by Merck's teams in Germany and the Netherlands, the solution integrates rule-based filtering, honeypot link tracking, and supervised machine learning to improve downstream engagement analytics.

## Project Highlights

- Applied rule-based time filters and honeypot detection to label bot interactions.
- Developed classification models (XGBoost, Random Forest, KNN) to distinguish human from bot clicks.
- Used clustering and anomaly detection to uncover behavioral patterns in engagement data.
- Enhanced targeting models for customer journey optimization and next-best action systems.
