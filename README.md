**Short Description:**  
A supervised ML pipeline that detects inorganic (bot-driven) email opens and clicks among healthcare professionals by combining rule-based heuristics and honeypot link labeling into a single, high-accuracy classifier.

## Introduction

Customer email engagement is one of the most efficient ways to reach healthcare professionals (HCPs). However, not all recorded opens and clicks represent genuine human behavior—some are triggered by bots.

This project builds on internal R&D at Merck to develop a robust ML-based classifier for distinguishing human vs. bot interactions in email logs. By integrating labeling signals from rule-based filters and honeypot links, we trained supervised models to detect inorganic engagement with high reliability.
